										<h2>What is our mission?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>We're a group of people interested in exploring how we can interact with data to make positive change for local Delaware communities. We are civic-minded. We are developers. We are designers. We are beginners. We are experts. We are everything in-between. It doesn't matter how much experience you have, all you need is a willingness to learn and a desire to help your community. We meet regularly to work on projects and build community together. If you're not sure what Open Data actually is, that's okay! We love to share our knowledge with anyone curious. For a starter, take a look at Open Knowledge International's <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/">Open Data Handbook: What is Open Data?</a></p>

												<h3>Our founders in plaid</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Like all successful civic groups, we have founders who have enough passion and zeal to carry us through thick and thin. 

											<br><br><a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://twitter.com/rharrington31">Ryan Harrington</a> (left) helps to build the emerging tech community in Delaware as the Education & Nonprofit Coordinator at 1313 Innovation.  In this role, he works to build an entrepreneurial pipeline for the state, hoping to inspire students by teaching them about startup culture and emerging technologies.  Previously he taught upper-level math at Glasgow High School as a Corps Member for Teach for America.  Before coming to Delaware, Ryan was a student at Rutgers University where he majored in Environmental & Business Economics and minored in Philosophy.  While teaching, he also earned his Masters in Secondary Education from Wilmington University.

											<br><br> Outside of work, Ryan is pursuing a Masters of Science in Business Analytics with a focus on data science at Drexel University.He also co-founded and co-organizes Open Data Delaware, a meetup group that advocates for government transparency and the use of civic technology.  He also spends time mentoring high school students as part of the Delaware Youth Leadership Network

												<h3>Code & Coffee </h3>
											</header>
											<p>Every Saturday at 10am we gather together at the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://nccde.org/294/Brandywine-Hundred-Library">Brandywine Hundred Library's</a> Program Room on the first floor. We have an open door policy and welcome anyone curious to join us at any time. (We even have a friendly little sign to point out the way.) 

											<br><br>We begin with the coffee and foods, of course, and spend a few minutes chatting. Like any successful civic tech group, we’re not just a coalition; we’re friends, and we like to chat. After a bit, one of <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-Delaware/members/?op=leaders">our hosts</a> will rally us back together and give a brief presentation highlighting any updates or news for the group. At this time, each project group will have the opportunity to call out for any specific needs they have to meet their work goals for the week.

											<br><br>Additionally, if you’re interested in starting your own project, this is a great time to find others who are interested in ideating and incubating new ideas. When the intros are wrapped up and everyone has a table to join, we’ll get started on our projects in a freestyle form. These projects could be anything from long-running group efforts, to working through a tutorial with a partner, or just sharing a space to work on individual ventures.</p>
